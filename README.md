# Finding Solutions

## Objectives
* Determine the methods you can take to find information efficiently 
* <b>Google Tips and Tricks</b> to find new topics, code samples, scan search results, error handling and more


## METHOD 1: Check Lessons and Previous Assignments

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/5zbj7HTomGwJa37pWO/giphy.gif)

Lessons are designed to expose you to new topics quickly, followed with a practice coding assignment to build muscle memory.  Mostly likely the assignment you are working on has some answers in the lesson repository. The lesson repository goes into depth on the subject and has additional resource links to continue learning on the subject.

Lessons build on top of concepts from the previous lesson, you might have to dig into a lesson from a previous day, week or unit.

<b>Check the [class-info repository wiki](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-bees/class-info/wiki) for links to all of the lessons, practices and homework assignments organized by unit.</b>

### METHOD 2: Check with Your Partner

**During lessons:** you want to be respectful of your partner and their process of learning. So if it's a quick "I just lost a step and can you tell me what I missed", go for it. Otherwise, it's better to go to Step 3.

**During practice assignments:** Unless it's a pair programming/group assignment, it's better to go to Step 4.

**After class:** Study together, ask questions, teach each other and queue up with your TA!


### METHOD 3: Post Your Questions in The Parking Lot

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0He9nwYaiP7M7zEs/giphy.gif)

The parking lot slack channel is used to ask questions and start conversations about topics that are still unclear. Maybe we covered a concept but already moved on or maybe it's a question that is out of the scope of the lecture, the parking lot is the best place to discuss these topics. 

*It is encouraged that if you feel like you know the answer to a question posted by your fellow classmates, contribute to the conversation.*

**Ask and answer questions during the lecture, but don't forget to focus on the new material being covered.**


### METHOD 4: Google is Your Best Friend


![](https://media.giphy.com/media/o1sHpyku3WDrW/giphy.gif)

You can search and find literally anything on Google. The amount of information can be an overload. The key is learning how to narrow your search by targeting keywords and quickly finding the resource that will help YOU to find your answer. 

Do a Google search for ```how to search on google``` and you will find this resource 
### [How to search on Google](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/134479?hl=en)

> **Start with the basics**
> <br>
> No matter what you're looking for, start with a simple search like `where's the closest airport?`. You can always add a few descriptive words if necessary.
If you're looking for a place or product in a specific location, add the location. For example, `bakery seattle`. 

#### Programming Examples: 
* Add `js` - **no need to type out javascript**
* Add `css`,`html`,`sql`,`ruby` - be specific to the language
* Add `react`,`express`,`rails` - be specific to the framework

* Add `tutorial` - if you want to learn something
* Add `error` - if you want to target an error


> **Choose words carefully**
> <br>
> When you're deciding what words to put in the search box, try to choose words that are likely to appear on the site you're looking for. For example, instead of saying `my head hurts`, say `headache`, because that’s the word a medical site would use.

#### More Programming Examples: 

* `making things in javascript values` —> `js data types`

* `how do I create a for loop in javascript` —> `js for loops`


> **Don’t worry about the little things**
> * **Spelling.** Google's spell checker automatically uses the most common spelling of a given word, whether or not you spell it correctly. 
> * **Capitalization.** A search for `New York Times` is the same as a search for `new york times`.


### [Search Operators](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433)

> **Exclude words from your search**
> Put - in front of a word you want to leave out. For example, `jaguar speed -car`

> **Search for an exact match**
> Put a word or phrase inside quotes. For example, `"tallest building"` 

## Let's make some Google searches

**You want to change a number to a string**

Search [`number to string js`](https://www.google.com/search?q=number+to+string+js)


1. Look for information on the search results page without clicking links
2. Use the drop downs to find your answer, *this is what you were looking for!*


**Can’t remember concat?**

Search [`combine string`](https://www.google.com/search?q=combine+string)

Now add `js` to your search: [`combine string js`](https://www.google.com/search?q=combine+string+js)

*See the difference in your results?*
1. First version gives you articles that refer to C#, Python, etc. Not what you want.
2. Second version gives you all Javascript options, such as this one: [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_concat_string.asp)
  * click on try it
  * change a value 
  * click run button
  * click me button, *this is what you were looking for!*

**Stack Overflow**

Search [`concat arrays js`](https://www.google.com/search?q=concat+arrays+js)
1. Read the definition
2. W3schools
3. Check out [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1584370/how-to-merge-two-arrays-in-javascript-and-de-duplicate-items)
* This is a great question and answer, it is high in upvotes
* Scan the the question quickly and go to the answer code, *this is what you were looking for!*


**In order to understand loops and while loops**

Search [`for loop js`](https://www.google.com/search?q=for+loop+js)

> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration

_Very informative, but maybe an overload_

> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/loops-in-javascript/

_Image is great, but not quite what you need_

Let's keep searching for a better resource...

> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp

And the end of this page will take you a new topic `while loops`, *this is what you were looking for!*

> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_while.asp


#### Other Tips:

* Check out the **Video** section or tab for more visual content on the topic
* When searching to resolve errors, take out out specific line number details and focus on the key words of the error as well as adding the language, framework or topic

#### Sample Error search

**While working on your javascript project, you encounter this error in your console:**

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined
```

* Copy and paste the error to search for solutions.

[`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined`](https://www.google.com/search?q=Uncaught+TypeError%3A+Cannot+read+property+%27value%27+of+undefined&oq=Uncaught+TypeError%3A+Cannot+read+property+%27value%27+of+undefined)


* Refine your search with the tips described in this lesson.

[`error cannot read property of undefined js`](https://www.google.com/search?q=error+cannot+read+property+of+undefined+js&oq=error+cannot+read+property+of+undefined+js)

1. Look for information on the search results page without clicking links
2. Use the drop downs to find your answer
3. Check stack overflow - scan quickly
4. Read articles. *These are more helpful!*
